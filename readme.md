janked up python game i cooked up in 30 minutes

place your mp3 files in a subfolder called "music" and it will pick random songs to play to you from there

as long as your answer is in the filename it will accept it as an answer

once you get your answer right (or if you type in "give up", or if you simply dont get it) the game will display the filename of the song and play the song. press ctrl+c to move on.

happy playing!
